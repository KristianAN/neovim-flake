* Neovim flake for all my development needs
** Language support
   Currently set up to work ootb for these languages
   - Java
   - Scala
   - Rust
   - Haskell
   - Lua

   Adding new languages is a relatively simple task of just adding the tree-sitter module, adding the lsp as a runtime dep and setting up lspconfig.
